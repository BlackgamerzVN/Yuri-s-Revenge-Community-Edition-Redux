Field Manual - Reconnaissance 

Reconnaissance, or Scouting for short, is a very important part during the early stages of the game. It is performed by sending recon infantries on area covered by the fog of war, which is usually indicated by black zones. Explored area provides pernament field visual, revealing both the terrain and enemy base intelligent. Scouting oppotunities diminish as the battle progresses, as such it is crucial to scout fast and thoroughly, especially on the enemy base.

The explored field also transfer over to your mini-radar. Mini-radar is provided by your Radar structure. As it cover a small area of battlefield interface, it assists you of watching over the whole battle theater. It is temporary disabled either if your Power is low or your Radar structure is Destroyed.

When in doubt, use Recon Support Power provided by Radar structure as Soviet and Yuri.

If Epsionage Units reach your Radar structure, all explored area intelligence will be lost, except the area under the visual of your structures and units. Constructing a Spy Sattelite will help prevent this. Keep in mind that if a Spy Sattelite is infiltrated, your movement will be recorded by the owner of Epsionage Units regardless of whenever your Spy Sattelite destroyed or not. And if your Spy Sattelite is destroyed, your surrounding intelligance will be in the state just as vulnerable as if a Spy has infiltrated your Radar.

As the Allied and the Soviet, your best option of scouting are Attack Dogs with fast mobility, great vision and resonable price of 200$ each. They can singlehandedly devour lone infantry, but perform poorly as anti-infantry units due to low range and durability. They are also extremely ideal for detecting spies, use them to root out any suspicious infantry.

As the Yuri army, there are two viable options. The first is Initates basic infantry, who can provide great visual sight, output great damage and can garrison structures if needed, albeit slower than Attack Dogs. The second of which is the Brute as a fast and close-ranged anti-tank infantry, along with the immunity against dogs' bites. While fast, it sees in slightly less radius comparing to Initiate and ill suited for anti-infantry role.

Both can't detect spies however. See alternatives in the Yuri Armory Profiles.

Field Manual - Units Acquisition

"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle." - Sun Tzu, The Art of War

Chapter I: Production

Each type of Unit can be available for production if certain criterias are met. All units are divided into three Grades: Tier I, Tier II and Tier III

The higher the Tier, the more lethal they are. But also provide guarrantee increase in Production Cost.

Standard Units are Tier I units, eligible for mass production as soon as their respective production structure is built:

Barrack -> Standard Infantry units - Unlocks Engineer

War Factory -> Standard Vehicle Units - Unlocks Resource Miners

Naval Yard -> Standard Naval Units - Unlocks Amphibious Transports

Support and Specialist Units are Tier II Units, unlockable by building Structures that meets the Technology Prerequisition: 

Radar Structure Provides Specialist and Support Units, both of which are graded Tier II. For the Allies, Airfield also serves as Radar Structure. Tier II Units and Structures can also be requisited by establishing Technology Center Structures.

Tier II Infantry Unlocks guarranteed 1 Elite Anti-Ground and 1 Specialized Anti-Personel Infantry. Tier II Vehicle Unlocks guarranteed 1 Dedicated Siege Artillery Vehicles.

Advanced Units are Tier III Units, obtained upon the completion of building Technology Center constructions:

Technology Center Structure, also under the name of "Battle Lab", serves as an requirement for production of Tier III Advanced Units. The Acquisition of Advanced Units depends on each faction primary doctrines.

It is greatly recommended to build more production structures to hasten the production rates of respective units.

Field Manual - Deployment of Combat Units

Chapter II: Deployment

When it comes to deployment of unit. It's important to know what,when and where your units are under ideal condition to fight other units.

On direct confrontation, Tier determine the survivability of a unit. Units with superior Tier can dominate other units in direct confrontation. Units with inferior Tier has great Production Time and support abilities, whilst also easier to gain Veterancy. The ranking of its Tier are calulated on 3 primary factors: Mobility, Protection and Firepower.

Mobility is required for responsiveness against flanking assaults and targeting vulnerable artillery units. It also accounts for how fast can a unit rotate from one direction to another, or if it can perform actions while maintaining the same speed.

Protection indicates how long a unit survivability in direct fight. It factors how long can a unit sustain recieved damage before it's decommissioned from battle scenerio. Different Armor Types provides different survivability agaisnt variety of Weapon Types. Protection increases when a Unit Type has the ability to Self Heal.

Firepower accumulates from Estimated Damage, Rates of Fire, Weapon Range and Lethality Rates from a Weapon Types. A Unit may possess one or more Weapon Types. As its Weapon Types increases their effectiveness versus different Unit Types, so is its Firepower status.

Units can also be promoted under three kind of rank: Green, Veteran and Elite. Their Growth Rate are determined by their Production Cost. As a requirement of increasing veterancy, a Unit need to eliminate enemy units valued two times its cost. When a Unit Type rank is increased, Speed, Protection and Firepower is enhanced. When a unit reached their maximum rank, they earn the ability to self heal and weapon upgrades.

Unit Types are most effective in certain Terrain. Infantry Units are excellent in Forest and Urban scenerio, Ground Vehicles excels in traversing flat terrain, Aerial Vehicles bypass rough terrain and ground obstacles, Naval Units dominates the sea. A battalion of units shine best on high level of Terrain or exit of narrowed area. Occupation of those two types of strategic points is vital to your success.

You may also Garrison your Standard Infantry to civilian structures. Units under Garrison gain significant firepower improvement and extra protection against anti-infantry threats. Garrisoned Structures can be repaired by Engineers. If captured by an Engineer, some of Neutral Structure can provide different kind of sustantial benefits to your battle plans. We call them Technology Structures.

There's also Deploy Command available for all Commanders. Deploy Command orders the unit to perform special modes, providing that units has alternative weapons. Do note that alternative weapons has their own pros and cons, use them accordingly.

LongDescription=$$$TextBlockBegin$$$

Field Manual - Reading Profiles

Profiles represents the general status of a Structure Type or a Unit Type of a Faction arsenal.

Each Profiles includes a Brief Description. Brief Description provides you with basic ideas of what the Structure Type or Unit Type can do, and what part that Structure Type or Unit Type performs.

A Unit Type, or Structure Type, inherits 5 basic statistic: Cost, Durability, Armor_Types, Mobility, Visibility and Tier. Acquisition of each Tier is written in Chapter I of | Overview of Units Usage |.

A Unit may inherit Primary and Secondary weapon. If a Unit have neither of them, they are classified as Non-combatant. A Structure may also equipped with weapons.

Primary and Secondary contains 5 main statuses: Estimated Damage, Rate of Fire, Weapon Range, Lethality Rates and Elite Bonuses.

Estimated Damage determines how much damage it does to target's Durability.

Rates of Fire determines how fast it fires. This is however calculated by time (frames). Therefore the lower Rates of Fire is, the faster the Unit/Structure Types shoot its weapon.

Lethality Rates determines the effectiveness against its armor. On Profiles Lethality Rates are written on 9 percentages of number. These represents Armor Types respectively: None, Flak, Plate, Light, Medium, Heavy, Wood, Steel, Concrete.

None, Flak, Plate Armor Types are equipped by Infantries. Light, Medium, Heavy Armor Types are equipped by Vehicles. Wood, Steel, Concrete are equipped by Structures.

Elite Bonuses is the weapon upgrade a Unit will recieve when reached the rank of Elite. The effect of which varies on Weapons and Unit Types.

If a Unit is not Incapable of being Promoted. Additional Veterancy Bonuses is provided when a Unit reached the rank of Veteran and Elite. Bostering the already formidable firepower.

* Important Notes: What is provided on Veteran Rank will NOT be provided again on Elite Rank. For instance if a Unit Profiles state it can gain extra speed on Veteran and Elite. While provided on Veteran Rank, it will not have extra speed increase on Elite Rank.

* Only exceptions are FIRERATE and ROT bonuses. If you see those in both Veteran and Elite bonuses document, that means your Elite weapon upgrades now also recieves bonuses from Veteran rank.

Allied Forces - General Profile

The Allied Forces, also known as the Allied Nations, and commonly preferred to as the Allied, are a military alliance formed by the democratic nations of Western Europe to deter and defend against external threats, particularly the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin and later, Alexander Romanov. They are renowed for their extensive uses of Space-time technologies, known as Chrono Technology, and energy refractor technology, which is classified as Prism Technology.

Allied units are trained and developed from various sites on NATO regions, prominently Korea, USA, Britain, Germany and France. Their arsenal are characterized by an reliance on balance of mobility, durability and firepower. Comparing to Yuri units and Soviet units, Allied units are well-trained and better equiped. Some are specialized against certain type of unit.

They not only train regular armies, but also Special Operation Units as well. Allied Spec Ops Unit are excellent in sabotaging enemy advantage conventionally and unconventionally, often backed by their most powerful Support Weapon named the Chronosphere.

Some Allied units also master in the art of disguise, concealing themselve from the sight of our own troops. Attack Dogs can neutralize disguise, though Commanders can also issue manual attack order to eliminate anything whom they find suspicious of. On Battlefield Control, you can issue your army to manual attack if your mouse appear attack cursor on a suspicious unit or object.

Additionally, you may need to pay attention of their Gap Generator towers too. Those are greatly capable of keeping intelligence hidden and disrupting the targeting of Soviet rocket system. It's ill advised to target areas where they are covering and highly suggested to focus on targeting powerplants as Gap Generators are power consuming.
